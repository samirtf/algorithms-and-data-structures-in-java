We use loop invariants to help us understand why an algorithm is correct. We
must show three things about a loop invariant:

1. Initialization: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.
2. Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the
next iteration.
3. Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property
that helps show that the algorithm is correct.
